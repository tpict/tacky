# Tacky

A library for building safe, consistent styles in TypeScript.

```tsx
const styles = tacky(_ => [
  _.color(_.rgb(255, 0, 0)),
  _.backgroundColor(_.rgb(0, 0, 128)),
  _.fontSize(_.rem(5)),
  _.fontFamily("Times New Roman", "serif"),
  _.boxShadow(_.rem(2), _.rem(2), _.rem(2), _.rem(2), _.rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)),
  _.media([_.media.screen(_.media.minWidth(_.rem(30)))],
    _.color(_.rgb(0, 255, 0)),
  ),
]);

// Equivalent to
const styles = {
  color: "rgb(255, 0, 0)",
  backgroundColor: "rgb(0, 0, 128)",
  fontSize: "5rem",
  fontFamily: '"Times New Roman", sans-serif',
  boxShadow: "2rem 2rem 2rem 2rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)",
  ["@media screen and (min-width: 30rem)"]: {
    color: "rgb(0, 255, 0)",
  },
};
```

## Installation

```
yarn add tacky-css
```

## Why?

Because No One Else Wouldâ„¢

If you use [object styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles) or [style
objects](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects) (or
something else) to represent CSS in your styling library of choice, you may
have found the type definitions of various CSS properties to be looser than you
were expecting.  If you're writing a [library of CSS type definitions
_only_](https://github.com/frenic/csstype), you have to use the `string` type
liberally in order to capture all possible values of properties that can be
represented with scalar [CSS data
types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types).

Tacky is a library inspired by
[bs-css](https://github.com/reasonml-labs/bs-css) and
[elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css) that takes a functional
approach in order to provide safety that can't be guaranteed by a `Record`
interface alone.

### Why are values specified unit-first?

Standard [object styles](https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles) allow any
string for scalar CSS values e.g. `"2rem"`, `"5px"`, because it's not feasible
to enumerate every possibility of those values. By expressing these as a "unit
function" that receives magnitude as a number, we can be much more strict about
what values are allowed for a given property.

### Why write styles as a list of function calls?

Many CSS properties are multi-dimensional or have multiple syntaxes, so
representing their values safely with TypeScript warrants the use of a helper
function. Using object styles, you wind up with something like:

```tsx
const styles = {
  flex: flex(1, 0, "auto")
  padding: padding(rem(1), rem(2)),
};
```
By having these helper functions produce both the CSS property _and_ value, we
can avoid this redundancy.

### Why all the underscores?

TypeScript has no directive for "import a module into the current namespace".
By specifying styles as a function that receives Tacky's utilities as an
object, you can use any identifier without introducing it into the rest of your
module. I like `_` because it's terse, but you can use whatever you like:

```tsx
const styles = tacky(css => [css.color("red")]);
```


## TODOs

- [ ] Support all (relevant) CSS properties
- [x] Support media queries
- [ ] Support selectors (?)
- [ ] Companion React library
- [ ] Auto builds (?)
